# My Portfolio 

This repository is where I showcase all my data analyst projects. These projects demonstrate my skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, R and Excel. 

## About Me

My name is Diondra Stubbs. I am a recent graduate of the University of Rhode Island. I received a B.S. in Applied Mathematics with concentration in data science and statistics. I am an aspiring data analyst working to advance my knowledge in skills such as SQL, Tableau, Python and Excel.

My interest for data analystics began in 2021 when I was leaning exploratory data analysis in my introductory programming class. In order to file a degree requirement I was required to take a computer science course and I chose intro to programming. Since them I have grown to enjoy gathering insights from data. WHat interests me most about data is how you can make numbers tell a story. The average onlooker has no idea what they're looking at when they come across a data set. Analyzing data can make it understandable to all. 

My background is mainly in state environmental management and education, which enabled me to refine hard skills such as Excel and Python. I spent a brief period doing research analyst work with EARI/BW Research enabling me to work with Excel, Tableau, Python, and Qualtrics. Due to my course experience, I have an understanding of machine learning and other data science concepts. I also have experience with programming language R.

My passions lie in EDA, statistical modeling and visualizing data to tell a story.
