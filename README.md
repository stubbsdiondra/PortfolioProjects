# My Portfolio 

This repository is where I showcase all my data analyst projects. These projects demonstrate my skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, R and Excel. Some include the use of Google Sheets and Google Data Studio.

## About Me

Recent Graduate and Entry Level Data Analyst, with experience in Excel, SQL, Tableau and Python.

My background is mainly in state environmental management and education, which enabled me to refine hard skills such as Excel and Python. I spent a brief period doing research analyst work with EARI/BW Research enabling me to work with Excel, Tableau, Python, and Qualtrics. Due to my course experience, I have an understanding of machine learning and other data science concepts. I also have experience with programming language R.
