# My Portfolio Project Repository

This repository holds all of the code and queries from the Portfolio Projects I created. These projects demonstrate my skills in SQL, Python and R. 

## About Me

My name is Diondra Stubbs. I am a recent graduate of the University of Rhode Island. I received a B.S. in Applied Mathematics with concentration in data science and statistics. I am an aspiring data analyst working to advance my knowledge in skills such as SQL, Tableau, Python and Excel.

My interest for data analystics began in 2021 when I was leaning exploratory data analysis in my introductory programming class. In order to file a degree requirement I was required to take a computer science course and I chose intro to programming. Since them I have grown to enjoy gathering insights from data. What interests me most about data is how you can make numbers tell a story. The average onlooker has no idea what they're looking at when they come across a data set. Analyzing data and telling a story can make it understandable to all. 

My passions lie in EDA, machine learning and visualizing data to tell a story.
