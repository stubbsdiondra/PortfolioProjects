# COVID-19 Data Exploration Project

This project explores COVID-19 data from January 2020 to November 2022. Basic to advanced SQL queries are executed to answer questions and look at trends over the course of COVID-19. After the data exploration is complete in SQL, the queries are used to create some data visualizations in Tableau. My data exploration in SQL can be viewed [here](https://github.com/stubbsdiondra/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/COVID-19%20Data%20Exploration%20Project/COVID-19%20Data%20Exploration%20Project.sql) and my dashboard in Tableau [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/diondra.stubbs/viz/COVID-19Project2022/Dashboard1).

## The Data

The dataset is from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). It has data from January 2020 to November 2022. I manipulated the data in Excel to contain the columns I wanted to work with.

## Task

The goal of this project is to explore 2020-2022 COVID-19 Data by performing queries in SQL. I choose to look at insights for the United States since I am a US citizen. I also explored data globally and regionally.
