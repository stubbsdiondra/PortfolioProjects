# PROGRAM TITLE: AFRICA HAPPINESS & SOCIAL SUPPORT APPROXIMATION PROGRAM

# PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: A Python program that approximates the average overall happiness scores 
#                      of the continent Africa from 2015 to 2020 and the average social support 
#                      factor in Africa between 2015 and 2020. 

# GENERAL SOLUTION: This program consists of the use of several variables such as integer and float,
#                   representing and storing data collected from the annual World Happiness Reports 
#                   from 2015 to 2020. These variables are used to compute the averages of happiness 
#                   scores and social support factors in Africa from 2015 to 2020. The calculations 
#                   to compute these averages, include the use of arithmetic operators such as 
#                   addition (+) and division (/). They also include variable operators. As a result, 
#                   this program outputs these averages using a print statement. The print statement 
#                   involves string formatting and concatenation to combine integers, floats and 
#                   strings in itâ€™s output.

                   
#PSEUDOCODE:

# define integer variable to hold and compute the number of years between 2015 and 2020
# define float variables to hold the average happiness scores of Africa from years between 2015 and 2020
# define float variable to compute the average happiness scores of Africa from 2015 to 2020
# define float variables to hold the average social support factors of Africa from years between 2000 and 2015
# define float variable to compute the average social support factors of Africa from 2015 to 2020
# print average happiness scores and social support factors of Africa from 2015 to 2020
