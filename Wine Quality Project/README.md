# Wine Quality Machine Learning Project

This is a machine learning project using supervised and unsupervised learning. Clustering is unsupervised learning for a categorical target.. That means we do not have the labels to learn from. We aim to learn both the labels for each point and some way of characterizing the classes at the same time. Classification is supervised learning for a categorical target.

## About the Dataset

This dataset is the result of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The analysis determined the quantities of 13 constituents found in each of the three types of wines. More about this [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine).
