# Presidents of the US Datasets

This is an exploratory data analysis project on US presidents data using pandas and matplotlib. The python notebook includes markdown explaining each part of my analysis.

For this analysis, I merged 3 datasets. I gathered two datasets that contain the birthdays and birth states of the US Presidents. More about those can be found [here](https://people.math.sc.edu/Burkardt/datasets/presidents/presidents.html).

The third dataset was gathered from Kaggle. It contains when the president was elected, when their term ended, their previous occupation, their supporting party and the vice president during their term. More can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harshitagpt/us-presidents).

I'm also using a dataset that contains the 50 states, their abbreviation, region and division. More about this dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omer2040/usa-states-to-region).

I also created .csv from web scraped data.

## Why Combine the Datasets

Who is the first born president of each region?
Which president was the youngest at the time of election?
Does the states presidents were born in vary over time?
