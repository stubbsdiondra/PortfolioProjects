# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

For this project, I assume the role of Senior Data Analyst for Maven Airlines, a US-based airline headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts. The latest passenger survey results just came in and it looks like the satisfaction rate dipped under 50% for the first time ever. The leadership team needs to take action fast, so they've brought me in to analyze the data and find the key areas to focus on for getting back on track.

Tool Used: Excel | Skills: Formulas, Pivot Tables, Charts

## Analysis

My goal is to recommend a data-driven strategy for increasing Maven Airlines' satisfaction rate. I used Excel functions, formulas, pivot tables and charts to draw insights. In the end I complied it onto a single-report Dashboard (shown below).

## Recommendations

The recommended strategy for Maven Airlines to increase their satisfaction rate is to focus on improving the services they offer. 

They primarily need to focus on making the pre-boarding experience better for customers. Maven can start by making the online booking process easier. They can do this by asking questions surrounding if their online booking service is easy to use, easy to find and speedy. For the check-in service, how long is the wait time? Would investing in Auto Check-in improve these ratings? Maybe implementing some type of rewards system or account to returning users would give Maven an opportunity to give returning passengers seniority when it comes to online boarding. This may be a good strategy given that 82% of their passengers are returning customers. To improve gate location, how easily accessible is the gate location? Is it easy to find? Are gate locations changing often?

Further recommendations include improving the Wi-Fi service, cleanliness and food and drink offered. Is the Wi-Fi fast? Is it easily accessible? The planes need to be cleaned better. Do we need to invest in better cleaning products? Do employees need to clean more regularly or efficiently? What food is being offered now? In what ways can we see what passengers prefer? Maybe looking at external data surrounding what people prefer to eat can give us insight.
