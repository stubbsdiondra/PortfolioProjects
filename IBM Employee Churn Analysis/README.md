# IBM Employee Churn Case Study

As a Senior Business Analyst as IBM, I was informed that the latest company report was released and the employee retention rate has dropped to 84%.

My job is to discover what the key drivers are for employees churning and predict IBM employees at risk of churning. My team has already suggested that a Decision Tree or Gaussian NB machine model is best for prediction, but my job is to fit another classifier and compare it to the ones my team drafted and use exploratory data analysis, visualizations and accuracy scores to make recommendations for IBM to increase employee retention and choose the best performing model.

Tools Used: SQL, Python and Tableau

Skills Used: JOINS, AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS, CREATING VIEWS, Machine Learning, Data Visualizations, Data Analysis
